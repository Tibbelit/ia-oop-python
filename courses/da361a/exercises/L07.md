# Lab 4

## Introduction

In this lab, you will familiarize yourself with peewee, an ORM solution for python, with the use of *args and **kvargs, and practice Object Oriented Programing.

The assignment  will be to construct a simple twitter program for Malmö University - MAUtter.In this assignment , you should use a database system of your choice. One simple option is to use SQLite, whereas the other option could be PostgreSQL.

The official documentation for peewee is available at <http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/>

The outcome of the lab should be twofold.

First you should learn how to use inheritance for non-logical scenarios (e.g. not only between Human and Student, but also between object types that are not necessarily logically related in real life).

Second, you will learn peewee, which is similar to django - an ORM that makes it easy to build end-to-edn applications without worrying about database level things.

## Prerequisites

### Install pip (python package manager)

pip is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python. Very likely tou already have pip. In the terminal, type:

```cmd
    pip
```

If you get instructions how to use it - you are fine. If you get pip (or pip3) not found, you likely need to install it.

``` cmd
    sudo easy_install pip (mac os x)

```

### Install peewee

Peewee is a simple and small ORM. Object-relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping tool) in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language. 

``` cmd
    pip3 install peewee
```

## Assignement

The Malmö University twitter app (MAUtter) should have a class in which you describe users and messages that each user wrote. Every user should have a username, full_name, email_address, and country of residence attributes. The usernames should be unique. Every message should have an identifier (a foreign key that maps to the primary key of the user) and the attribute for a message (a string of text) that represents the message itself.  The UML diagram of the lab can be seen on image below.

### Step-by-step instructions

1. Understand what foreign keys are, and how they are used. You can use this example here: <http://www.databasedev.co.uk/primary_foreign_key_constraints.html>  

2. Create a BaseClass where you inherit from peewee model and where you set the use of a database in the Meta nested class.

    A good practice to start is to define a BaseModel in which you configure common attributes for its child classes. In this way, classes that will inherit from BaseModel will already have the database (and any other attributes that you set) known.

    ``` python
    import peewee as pw
    mautter_db = pw.SqliteDatabase("mautter.db")

    class BaseClass(pw.Model):
        ''' This is the base class from which all our other classes will inherit 
            The benefit of having a common class is that we don't have to set the configuration in every other class.
        '''

        class Meta:
            ''' In Meta nested class we provide the configuration '''
            db = mautter_db

    ```
    If you encounter an ImportError it means that either flask or peewee was not found and may not be installed correctly. Check the Installing and Testing document for instructions on installing peewee. <http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/installation.html#installation>

3. Create a class for User(s) that inherits from your BaseClass and has the attributes described above.

    Help yourself with the slides from the lecture. A data type for attributes could be pw.CharField(), however, you can find many other data types here: <http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/models.html#field-types-table>

    ``` python
        ...
        username = pw.CharField(unique=True)  # makes a field unique
        ...
    ```

4. Create a class for Message(s) that inherits from your BaseClass and has the attributes described above. 

    ``` python
        Class User(BaseModel):
            ...
            #users messages will be accessible as a special attribute, User.messages
            user = pw.ForeignKeyField(User, backref='messages')
            ....
    ```

5. Create a separate file (e.g. app.py) and import the User and Messages class, and create stubs for the methods that you will need for the remainder of this lab.

    ``` python
        from (your file name here) import User
        from (your file name here) import Mweet

        def create_tables():
            ''' Our method where we will create the database tables'''
            pass

        def create_user(**kvargs):
            ''' Our method where we will create the user objects'''

        def create_messages():
            ''' Our method where we will create message objects '''

        def print_messages(uname):
            ''' Our method that will print out all the messages from a user '''

        def main():
            ''' out main method where we will call all other methods'''
            ...

        if __name__ == '__main__':
            main()
    ```

6. Finish the create_tables method so it creates the database tables. 
    Remember that since User and Mweet classes inherit from PW model, you can simply call User.create_table or Mweet. Create_table(). After the tables are created, inspect the database with an SQLite viewer (e.g. within VS code) to confirm that the correct tables were created. Use lecture slides to know where to search for.

7. Update the create_user method so it takes the arguments passed as **kvargs and create a new user. Below is an example solution.

    ``` python

        ...
        def create_user(**kvargs):
            ''' Our method where we will create the user objects'''

            new_user = User(**kvargs)
            new_user.save()
        ...

        create_user(username="aleks", full_name="Aleksander Fabijan",
                    country="Sweden", password="1234", email="aleksander.fabijan@mau.se")

    ```

    Take a few moments to understand how this code works. For example, try printing out the **kvargs to interpret the solution.

8. Create a few Mweets - messages.Because the messages are connected with a foreign key to the user, you will first need to find the reference to the user that the message belongs to.
    ``` python
            # we find out the reference to the user
        user_ref = User.get(User.username == username)

        msg = Mweet(user=user_ref, message=msg, likes=0)
        msg.save()

    ```
    Verify that the messages get stored in your database! 

9. Create a method print_messages(username:string) which prints out all of the messages for a given user. Note that you can use the backreference "messages" that you specified in the Mweet class to access them.
    ``` python

        def print_messages(uname):
            ''' Our method that will print out all the messages from a user '''
            user = User.get(username=uname)
            for msg in user.messages:
                print(msg.message)
    ```

### Extra challenges
Below are a number of extra challenges that you can attempt in case you've completed the lab above.

1. Implement password attribute for a user as an encrypted md5 field
2. Implement a method update_user(username, **kvargs) which takes a username as an input and updates whatever was passed in **kvargs, and saves the changes to the database.
3. Implement the method increase_likes which takes an id of a Mweet message (an integer) and increases the number of likes for it.
4. Update the create_messages() method to take **kvargs as an input.
